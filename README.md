# Death Landing Page

This project is a landing page for the legendary death metal band Death, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a modern and engaging page featuring interactive elements like sliders, API integration, and responsive design. The page includes core web components such as a header, navigation menu, main content sections, and footer.

The project utilizes external libraries like AOS for scroll animations, and it integrates the EmailJS API for sending messages through the contact form. Additionally, it uses the Last.fm API to display upcoming show dates and the band's biography, providing fans with up-to-date information directly on the page.

This is an exercise created for the FullStack Developer course by the +praTi and Codifica group.
